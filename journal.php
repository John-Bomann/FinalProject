					<p>
						Found orc girl in woods surrounded by bad looking orcs. All the bad orcs were killed real good. The girl, named Lash led them back to her village, where they met her father, an orc blacksmith named Lazgar. They then learned that there were more orcs like the ones they killed, and there was a village a couple days north. They then went to a cave previously used for mining to help gather resources for the blacksmith. After they helped it was revealed that there was an ancient library under one of the houses, and they hung out there for a little bit.

						They set off to the orc encampment. After some failed stealth, and an attempt to pet a cat, bloodshed ensued. After killing a lot of orcs, and mentally scarring another, they had succeeded. They took the scarred one with them, and he revealed that there was a larger camp up north. They headed back to the village to report back. In return for their service, they were given a magical book that could give information. They headed to the camp uneventfully aside from an owlbear encounter. It was large, so they scouted it out until they decided not to, and walked in to the leader, only to be trapped.

						We now flashback to the journey to the camp, because a player couldn't make it. As one of the characters sunbathed, the other two set off to map the area. Along the way, they encountered a panther like creature with tentacles being chased by an elf and a teleporting dog. After a short battle, the creature was vanquished, and they made friends with the elf (and dog), who turned out to be a weretiger. They also skinned the creature. They then set off into a spider infested cave. After a close call, they managed to kill all the spiders. They then dissected a teleporting spider, and stole its web fluid. One of the party members decided to consume the fluid, leading to an interesting experience with the ethereal plane.

					<p>
						Returning to the dangerous situation, the players managed to restrain the leader for just enough time to kill half a dozen orcs and make for an escape, barely making it out with their lives. They camped out in a tree only to find that the leader had followed them. However, the heroes had the advantage of flight, and pestered the leader back to his base. They began to return to the village, as the leader had threatened to wipe it out. Along the way however, they stopped by the stump of a dead tree, inhabited by a hag. They made a deal with a hag that in exchange for aid defending the village, they would owe her two favors.

					<p>
						The party begins the long trek back to the village. Armed with tree things to repel the invaders, they encountered some very large mosquito swarms, and collected magical mushrooms. They dealt with the weretiger undergoing the full moon transformation by giving her some catnip. They also worked on some magical items from the panther skin and spider web fluid.
